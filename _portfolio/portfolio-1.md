This project is an Interdisciplinary Group Project which requires collaboration between Mechanical, Industrial, Electrical and Mechatronics Engineering and it aims to motorize traditional handcarts in order to reduce physical effort and improve efficiency in manual transportation tasks.  
The project consists of 3 Milestones with concept design, product design and documentation. Until now, project plan has been made. Different work packages and responsibilities have been assigned to colleagues based on their capabilities and shown in Gantt chart.
