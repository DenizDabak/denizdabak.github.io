- Capacity calculation: Defining the number of necessary machines and workforce. 
  - Tact time
  - Define setups
  - Batch sizes
  - Which processes need workforce

-   Integration of PFMEA (Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) to address potential risks in production.  
-   It has been done for every production and assembly step. 
-   Designed for a biweekly production model (4,800 units/2 weeks).

-   2D floor plan including production area, shipment area, traffic routes, warehouses and developing an intralogistics concept.  
  
  This factory design demonstrates a comprehensive approach to managing large-scale manufacturing, balancing efficiency with flexibility while addressing potential production risks through preventive measures.
