-   ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is used for the outer housing because it is lightweight, durable and easy to manufacture with injection molding while having good impact resistance.  
-   The stainless steel spring is bought due to its high elasticity and fatigue resistance, essential for absorbing repeated shocks.

-   The assembly method involves attaching the spring to the inner rod and all other small parts by inserting and securing it with pre-made grooves. The outer housing is then fitted over the spring and rod, using thread-like connection to lock the components in place.
