This project explores a bionic gripper design based on the engulfing mechanism observed in the chameleon's tongue. Utilizing the principles of vacuum jamming, the prototype demonstrates an adaptable, low-cost and efficient gripping mechanism suitable for various applications in soft robotics and industrial automation.  

### Problem Statement

Traditional robotic grippers often rely on rigid mechanisms that struggle with irregularly shaped or delicate objects. Nature provides alternative strategies, such as the chameleon’s tongue, which envelops and secures prey with a soft yet firm grasp. My goal was to design a flexible gripper that mimics this engulfing behavior while keeping it under the fixed €30 budget. This constraint encouraged a design that prioritizes simplicity and adaptability.

### Bioinspiration & Design Process

I analyzed multiple natural engulfing strategies, considering inspirations from the chameleon, pelican, starfish and baleen whale. Through a structured evaluation after using morphological box and an assessment matrix comparison, the chameleon’s tongue stood out due to its ability to conform around objects and hold them securely with minimal energy input.

Using the design spiral approach, I refined the concept through iterative development:

-   Observation & Abstraction: Understanding the mechanics behind the chameleon's prehensile tongue.

-   Conceptual Translation: Identifying a suitable engineering principle, vacuum jamming, where granular material inside a membrane stiffens when air is removed. This effect occurs due to the increase in friction between granules when the air is evacuated, creating a solid-like structure that maintains its grip.

-   Prototype Development: A balloon filled with granular medium (e.g., black pepper balls with 2-3 mm diameter) that conforms around objects upon vacuum activation.

-   Testing & Optimization: Evaluating gripping efficiency, object adaptability and material variations to improve performance.


### Prototypes & Implementation

This simple yet effective approach allows the gripper to adapt to objects of varying sizes and shapes, ensuring a secure hold.

The gripper consists of:

A flexible balloon filled with granular material (such as coffee grounds, black pepper balls or rice), acting as the adaptive gripping surface.

A manual syringe that removes air, causing the granules to interlock and stiffen, securing the object in place.

A supportive handle to move the grasped object to desired location.
