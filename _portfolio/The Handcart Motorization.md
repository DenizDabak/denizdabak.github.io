This project focused on motorizing traditional handcarts to reduce physical effort and improve transportation efficiency. The final design features a quickly attachable motorized system with a shock-absorbing mount, making it ergonomic, lightweight and easy to install.

From initial freehand sketches to detailed CAD models and technical drawings, the design was refined through structural analysis, energy efficiency calculations and manufacturability considerations.
  
Developed in collaboration with an interdisciplinary team, combining expertise from mechanical, industrial, electrical and mechatronics engineering. My primary role focused on mechanical design, structural analysis and product optimization.

### Key Contributions and Engineering Process
-   Developed the motorized drive mechanism adaptable to existing handcarts.
-   Performed stress analysis & material selection to ensure durability while keeping the system lightweight.
-   Designed and optimized attachment brackets for quick installation using SolidWorks.
-   Engineered the motor integration, ensuring efficient power transmission and smooth acceleration.
-   Documented the final technical drawing & Bill of Materials (BOM) for manufacturing readiness.
-   Conducted cost analysis & production planning for efficient manufacturability.

The following visuals showcase how the design evolved from initial sketches to the final manufacturable product.

### Final Design Highlights  
-   Quick-Release Clamp System  : Tool-free attachment under 3 minutes.
-   350W Hub Motorized Wheel        : Provides enough power to carry 100 kg up a 10% incline.
-   Shock Absorption System     : Reduced impact forces, improving ride comfort.
-   Validated Optimized Manufacturing Design  : Material selection and production feasibility.

The system significantly reduces the physical effort required for transporting heavy loads, making it practical for industrial, agricultural and urban applications. The modular design allows it to be easily adapted to different cart sizes.
